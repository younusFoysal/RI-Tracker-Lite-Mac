# macOS Crash Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix crashes in the RI Tracker app on macOS related to permission handling.

## Issues Fixed

1. **App Crashing on Startup**: The app was crashing when starting up due to issues with the macOS permission request code.
2. **App Crashing When Starting Timer**: The app was crashing when clicking the start timer button due to permission-related issues.

## Root Causes

The crashes were caused by several issues in the permission handling code:

1. **Lack of Error Handling**: The code that checked for and requested macOS input monitoring permissions did not have proper error handling, causing unhandled exceptions that crashed the app.

2. **Threading Issues**: The timer used to schedule permission requests was not properly configured as a daemon thread, which could potentially prevent the app from exiting cleanly.

3. **Subprocess Hanging**: The code that opened System Preferences to request permissions could potentially hang indefinitely.

4. **Permission Check Failures**: The permission checking code did not gracefully handle all possible error conditions.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Improved Error Handling in Permission Request at Startup

Added comprehensive error handling to the permission request code that runs at app startup:

- Added try-except blocks around permission checking code
- Added try-except blocks around permission requesting code
- Made the timer a daemon thread to prevent blocking app exit
- Added error handling for timer creation
- Ensured system tracking is disabled if any errors occur

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in start_timer Method

Added robust error handling to the permission checking in the start_timer method:

- Wrapped permission checking in try-except blocks
- Wrapped permission requesting in nested try-except blocks
- Ensured the timer starts even if permission operations fail
- Added fallback to disable system tracking if permissions can't be checked or requested
- Added detailed error logging

### 3. Improved start_activity_tracking Method

Added error handling to the permission checking in the start_activity_tracking method:

- Added try-except blocks around permission checking
- Added nested try-except blocks around permission requesting
- Ensured activity tracking continues even if permission operations fail
- Added detailed error logging
- Gracefully degraded functionality by disabling system tracking when needed

### 4. Enhanced check_macos_permissions Method

Made the check_macos_permissions method more robust:

- Added check for pynput availability before attempting to use it
- Made the keyboard listener daemon to prevent blocking app exit
- Added a short delay to ensure the listener starts properly
- Improved error handling with more specific error messages
- Added fallback to return safe values even if unexpected errors occur

### 5. Improved request_macos_permissions Method

Enhanced the request_macos_permissions method:

- Added nested try-except blocks for better error isolation
- Added timeout to the subprocess call to prevent hanging
- Added specific handling for subprocess timeout errors
- Improved error reporting with detailed messages
- Added fallbacks for various error conditions

## Testing

A test script (`test_macos_fixes_verification.py`) has been created to verify the fixes. The script provides instructions for manually testing:

1. App startup
2. Timer start functionality
3. Permission request behavior
4. App closing with timer running

## Conclusion

These changes make the app more robust when dealing with macOS permissions. The app now:

1. Gracefully handles permission-related errors
2. Continues to function even if permissions are not granted
3. Provides better error messages for debugging
4. Prevents hanging or freezing when requesting permissions

The app should now open and function correctly on macOS, even if input monitoring permissions are not granted. System-wide activity tracking will be disabled if permissions are not available, but the app will continue to function using browser events for activity tracking.
