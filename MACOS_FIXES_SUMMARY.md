# macOS Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix two critical issues in the RI Tracker app on macOS:

1. App freezing when closing with timer running
2. Input monitoring permissions not being properly requested

## Issue 1: App Freezing on Close with Timer Running

### Problem
When the timer was running and the user tried to close the app on macOS, the app would freeze, showing a spinning wheel cursor and appearing as "not responding" in the dock.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by the confirmation dialog in the `handle_close_event` method. On macOS, showing a modal dialog from within a window closing event can cause the app to freeze.

### Solution
Modified the `handle_close_event` method to handle macOS differently:
- On macOS, the app now automatically stops the timer without showing a confirmation dialog
- This prevents the UI from freezing when closing the app
- The original confirmation dialog behavior is preserved on other platforms

The key change was to add a special case for macOS that bypasses the confirmation dialog and automatically stops the timer when the app is closed.

## Issue 2: Input Monitoring Permissions Not Being Requested

### Problem
The app was not properly requesting input monitoring permissions on macOS, resulting in the message "On macOS, system-wide tracking requires input monitoring permissions. Using browser events instead." This prevented the app from tracking real active time and idle time.

### Root Cause
The app was detecting macOS but not actively requesting permissions during initialization or when starting the timer. It was only checking for permissions but not requesting them if they were missing.

### Solution
Implemented three levels of permission requesting:

1. **During App Initialization**:
   - Added code to check and request permissions shortly after the app starts
   - This ensures users are prompted for permissions right away
   - A timer is used to delay the permission request until the app is fully loaded

2. **When Starting Activity Tracking**:
   - Modified the `start_activity_tracking` method to request permissions if they're missing
   - This ensures permissions are requested when activity tracking begins
   - The method now actively opens the System Preferences to the Input Monitoring tab

3. **When Starting the Timer**:
   - Added permission checking and requesting to the `start_timer` method
   - This is the most critical point where permissions are needed
   - The timer will still start even if permissions aren't granted, but system-wide tracking will be disabled until permissions are granted

These changes ensure that the app properly requests input monitoring permissions at multiple points, giving the user several opportunities to grant them.

## Testing

A test script (`test_macos_fixes.py`) has been created with instructions for manually testing both fixes. The script provides clear steps to verify that:

1. The app no longer freezes when closing with the timer running
2. Input monitoring permissions are properly requested

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that:
1. The app closes cleanly on macOS even when the timer is running
2. Input monitoring permissions are properly requested at multiple points
3. System-wide activity tracking works correctly once permissions are granted

The app now provides a better user experience on macOS and can accurately track real active time and idle time.
