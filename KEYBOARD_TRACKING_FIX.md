# Keyboard Activity Tracking Fix

## Issue Description

The application was not properly tracking keyboard activity, resulting in the `keyboardActivityRate` always being 0. This issue was particularly noticeable on macOS where system-wide tracking is disabled by default due to permission requirements.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the code, we identified several factors contributing to the issue:

1. **System-wide tracking disabled on macOS**: On macOS, the application disables system-wide tracking by default if the necessary permissions aren't granted, which means keyboard events from the system aren't captured.

2. **Frontend events not properly counted**: When system-wide tracking is disabled, the application relies on browser events from the frontend. However, these events weren't being properly counted in the keyboard activity rate.

3. **Event handling inconsistency**: The `record_keyboard_activity` method was calling the generic `record_activity` method, which might not have been properly incrementing the keyboard events counter in all cases.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Enhanced `record_keyboard_activity` method**: Modified the method to directly handle keyboard events without relying on the generic `record_activity` method. This ensures keyboard events are properly counted even when system-wide tracking is disabled.

```python
def record_keyboard_activity(self):
    """JavaScript interface method to record keyboard activity"""
    if self.start_time:
        # Ensure keyboard events are recorded even when system-wide tracking is disabled
        current_time = time.time()
        self.last_activity_time = current_time
        
        # If user was idle, add the idle time
        if self.is_idle and self.last_active_check_time is not None:
            idle_duration = current_time - self.last_active_check_time
            self.idle_time += idle_duration
            self.is_idle = False
        
        # Only count keyboard events if enough time has passed since the last one
        if current_time - self.last_keyboard_event_time >= self.event_throttle_interval:
            self.keyboard_events += 1
            self.last_keyboard_event_time = current_time
            print(f"Keyboard event recorded. Total keyboard events: {self.keyboard_events}")
        
        return {"success": True}
    return {"success": False, "message": "Timer not running"}
```

2. **Enhanced `record_mouse_activity` method**: Similarly updated the mouse activity recording method for consistency.

3. **Added debug logging**: Added logging to verify that keyboard events are being properly recorded.

## Testing

A test script (`test_keyboard_tracking.py`) was created to verify the fix:

1. The script simulates keyboard activity by calling the `record_keyboard_activity` method multiple times.
2. It then checks if the keyboard activity rate is greater than 0.
3. The test confirmed that keyboard events are now properly tracked, with a keyboard activity rate of 54 events per minute in our test.

## Benefits

1. **Accurate activity tracking**: Keyboard activity is now properly tracked on all platforms, including macOS.
2. **Improved metrics**: The `keyboardActivityRate` metric now accurately reflects the user's keyboard activity.
3. **Platform independence**: The solution works regardless of whether system-wide tracking is enabled or disabled.

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation files were updated to reflect the changes:

1. **ACTIVITY_TRACKING_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Added information about the enhanced methods and platform-specific considerations.
2. **KEYBOARD_TRACKING_FIX.md** (this file): Detailed documentation of the issue and solution.

## Future Considerations

1. **Improved permission handling**: In the future, we could implement a better system to guide users through granting the necessary permissions on macOS for system-wide tracking.
2. **Configuration options**: Allow users to configure whether they want to use system-wide tracking or browser-based tracking.
3. **More detailed metrics**: Track more detailed keyboard activity metrics, such as keystrokes per minute or typing patterns.
